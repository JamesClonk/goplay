GoNow
=====

**GoNow** allows using Go like if were a script language.

Internally, it compiles and links the Go file; the executable is saved into a
global directory if *GOROOT* or *GOPATH* is set, else it is saved in the local
directory "*.go"; then, it is run. If that executable does not exist or
its modified time is different than script's, then it's compiled again.

It works into a shared filesystem since it's created a directory for each target
environment.

"GoNow" is specially useful for:

+ Learning
+ Testing of code snippets
+ Administration issues
+ Boot init of operating systems
+ Web developing; by example for the routing
+ Interfaces of database models
