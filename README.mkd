goscript
========

**goscript** allows to use Go like if were a script language. The extension of
Go scripts has to be ".g".

Internally, it compiles the script file saving it into sub-directory ".go", then
it is run. If that binary does not exist or its modified time is different than
script's, then it's compiled again.

The use of Go scripts is especially useful:

+ During learning
+ For administration issues
+ Boot init of operating systems
+ Web developing; by example for the routing
+ Interfaces of database models
