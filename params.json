{"name":"Goplay","tagline":"Run Go source files automatically","body":"Goplay\r\n======\r\nUse Go like a scripting language.\r\n\r\n[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/JamesClonk/goplay?status.png)](https://godoc.org/github.com/JamesClonk/goplay) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JamesClonk/goplay.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JamesClonk/goplay)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n\t$ go get github.com/JamesClonk/goplay\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nGoplay requires the fsnotify package for \"hot reload\" functionality\r\n\r\n\t$ go get github.com/howeyc/fsnotify\r\n\t\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nYou can run any Go file by calling it with goplay\r\n\r\n\t$ goplay example.go\r\n\r\nThis is similar to using plain \"go run example.go\".\r\nThe real use of goplay is the ability to use it as a hashbang and run any Go files by itself\r\n\r\n\t$ ./example.go\r\n\r\nFor this to work, you have to insert the following hashbang as the first line in the Go file  \r\n\r\n\t#!/usr/bin/env goplay\r\n\r\nand set it to be executable\r\n\r\n\t$ chmod +x example.go\r\n\r\nGoplay can also be used to \"hot reload\" a Go app / script.      \r\nIf run with commandline flag *-r*, it will watch the source(s) for changes and recompile & reload them.\r\n\r\n\t$ goplay -r MyDevelopmentHttpServer.go\r\n\r\nSee usage message (-h or --help)\r\n\r\n\t$ goplay -h\r\n\tCompile and run a Go source file.\r\n\tTo run the Go source file directly from shell, insert hashbang \"#!/usr/bin/env goplay\" as the first line.\r\n\r\n\tUsage: goplay [OPTION]... FILE\r\n\r\n\tOptions:\r\n\t        -f              force (re)compilation of source file.\r\n\t        -b              use \"go build\" to build complete binary out of FILE directory\r\n\t        -r              Watch for changes in FILE and recompile and reload if necessary (enables force compilation [-f])\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\n\r\nThe *goplay* command enables you to use Go as if it were an interpreted scripting language.\r\n\r\nInternally, it compiles and links the Go source file, saving the resulting executable under the local directory \".goplay\", or any other directory specified by the configuration file ~/.goplayrc.\r\nAfter that it is executed with all commandline parameters passed along. \r\nIf that executable does not yet exist or its modified time is different than the scripts, \r\nthen it will be compiled again.\r\nWhen run in \"hot reload\" mode, it will always force recompilation of the script.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe source files are distributed under the [Mozilla Public License, version 2.0](http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/), unless otherwise noted.  \r\nPlease read the [FAQ](http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/FAQ.html) if you have further questions regarding the license.     \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
